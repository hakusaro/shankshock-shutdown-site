	<p><strong>It was inevitable</strong> that it would end like this. After several years of hosting Minecraft, ShankShock is ceasing operations as a Minecraft server host.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>On February 4th, 2015, <a href="https://mojang.com/2015/01/announcing-minecraft-name-changes/">Mojang will enable name changes</a> across the Minecraft login system. While newer servers will be able to cope with this, many older servers will not. The server API we used, Bukkit <a href="http://bukkit.org/threads/an-independent-goodbye.310086/">was all but abandoned</a> after it turned out that Mojang bought the software, as well as the team behind it. This, followed by a DMCA takedown notice from a former Bukkit developer lead to the effective shutdown and discontinuation of the server mod that we use to build the ShankShock Core services and infrastructure. While projects like <a href="http://www.spigotmc.org/">Spigot</a> and <a href="https://www.spongepowered.org/">Sponge</a> are attempting to pick up the slack, no clear successor has defined itself as of late. To compound things, the primary method for generating income on ShankShock was traditionally a donation system that offered in game benefits to users in exchange for real money. A recent <a href="https://mojang.com/2014/06/lets-talk-server-monetisation/">Mojang statement</a> already declared this type of monetization against their terms of service, despite the fact that many servers (including ours) had fair, equal redemption systems in place designed to deter pay to win capabilities. As a result, for the last several months, the server has operated in a soft shutdown state. This state allowed the server to continue operating, but no updates nor features were added or developed. Now that name changes are being enabled, it is no longer safe to continue hosting the server. Any admin who changes their name would effectively allow impersonation of themselves on our server. Further, any donor or other privileged user would open up the same possibilities.</p>
	<hr>
	<p>Donors with active forum accounts will be able to download the server within the coming weeks, including all plugins as well as database backups and the maps. The <a href="http://github.com/nicatronTg/ShankShock-Core">ShankShock Core</a> is already freely available on GitHub. The forums will be removed entirely (along with server downloads) soon after.</p>

	<p>The community lives on via Teamspeak, and many admins and donors can be found there. Thanks for being apart of something magical.</p><br/><p style="text-align: right">Lucas "Shank" Nicodemus</p>
